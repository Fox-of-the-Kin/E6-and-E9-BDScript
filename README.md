# E6-and-E9-BDScript

My code that uses e621 and e926 API to get furry shit using BDScript 2

Due note this is VERY shitty code as im new to it, theres a few issues with the commands, i will figure out how to fix em :3 

# Copyright info

You must add my name on the command as i do not like people not credit orignal sources of shit they are using

if you plan on using and modifying the code you must add `Code Made by @foxofthekin, Modifyed by (Your name here)` on the footer or anywhere on the command!

# Slash command information!

Slash commands ARE supported but need to be named `tag1` , `tag2` , `tag3` , `tag4` , `tag5`

Don't make any of them a requirement as not having a tag works fine (tho the image that gets fetched is ENTIRELY random)
